## Project Details

This repository contains code for the assignment: "Large scale data processing using Map-Reduce".
The assignment asked us to perform 3 activities:
1. Calculate word count on a corpus of downloaded tweets (arbitrary topic: "Donald Trump") and map the word counts on a word cloud.
  Please refer to Data-Processing-MapReduce/Activity 1/WordCloud_Trump.png for the end result.
2. Calculate word cooccurence on the same tweets using Pairs and Stripes methods and Hadoop.
  The outcome of these two activities is data that can be used to understand sentiments accompanying certain words. 
  For example, the adjective "humble" preceding a word "President" in "humble President", can be used to understand the sentiment around the word President.
3. Activity 3 included the lemmatization of a Latin text document to get the root word from a derived word. 
  Replacing words by their root forms helps in understanding the relationships between roots of words.
